This example serves to demonstrate the usage of cmake in relation to larger projects where the following features are
present:
- Subdirectory source tree;
- Non-trivial header dependencies (nested/hidden header dependencies);
- \todo update this list and add features.

To improve the organization of the expanded project, the top CMakeLists.txt file is separated into many `.cmake` files to
be subsequently included.

\todo Check if files are recompiled when necessary (but only when necessary).


# External Dependencies
 
- CMake (version 3.5.1).
- Doxygen (version 1.8.11 tested).
	- Note that files generated by CMake are ignored by Doxygen by setting `EXCLUDE_PATTERNS = */CMakeFiles/*`.

## Additional (Not required)
- g++ (version 7.1).
	- The steps in [this github post][install_latest_gcc_ubuntu_lts] were followed to perform the installation.
 
# Compiling and executing the code
 
From each of the src directories, make a build directory:
```{sh}
$ mkdir build && cd build
```
then execute cmake, pointing it to the directory of the top-level CMakeLists.txt file:
```{sh}
$ cmake \full\path\to\top-level\CMakeLists.txt\directory
```
After the Makefile is generated, `make` and launch the executable. Documentation can be generated using
```{sh}
$ make doc
```
