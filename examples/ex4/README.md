This example demonstrates the basic usage of [CMake] following the [CMake tutorial]. Note that the files, replicated
here with updates for the c++14 standard, are available from the CMake source tree in the
[Tests/Tutorial][cmake_step_files] directory.
 
The order in which the directories should be visited is:
- step1:
	- [basic](src/step1/basic/)
	- [add_header](src/step1/add_header/)

\todo Continue at step2.


# External Dependencies
 
- CMake (version 3.5.1).
- Doxygen (version 1.8.11 tested).
	- Note that files generated by CMake are ignored by Doxygen by setting `EXCLUDE_PATTERNS = */CMakeFiles/*`.
	- Further, the correct method to add multiple exclude patters is shown in [this SO discussion][SO_doxygen_exclude].
 
# Compiling and executing the code
 
From each of the src directories, make a build directory:
```{sh}
$ mkdir build && cd build
```
then execute cmake, pointing it to the directory of the top-level CMakeLists.txt file:
```{sh}
$ cmake ..
```
After the Makefile is generated, `make` and launch the executable.

\note To see the verbose output of `make` (including the compile command), enter:
```{sh}
make VERBOSE=1
```
