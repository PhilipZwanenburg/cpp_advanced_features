# Overview

The goal of this project is to provide small working examples demonstrating the incorporation of various library, code
and github functionality into a larger code. All examples below assume a unix-like operating system and were run on
Ubuntu release 16.04 LTS.

All examples presented here are written in c++ and include a comment block in `main.cpp` which outlines any library
dependencies along with command line instructions for how to observe the showcased functionality. Code to be entered on
the command line is presented as: `$ type_this_on_the_cmd_line`.

The examples should generally be reviewed in order as they may assume knowledge of previous examples.
